Social Media API 2

Rice Bootcamp Challenge Assignment 18: Social Network API [AT.2]

## Introduction

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this 
course, you’ll use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is 
data, it’s important that you understand how to build and structure the API first.

The challenge this week is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend 
list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js Links to an external site.and Mongoose Links to 
an external site.packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

## User Story

SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API

THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
